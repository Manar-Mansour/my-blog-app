    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my personal blog! My name is Manar Mansour. 
        I am a Full-stack web developer with an M.Sc degree and 
        more than 5 years of multidisciplinary experience. 
        I developed and implemented novel algorithms and programs
        that were adopted by US companies in the silicon valley 
        and a technology spin-off start-up in the AUC.
        I am the first author of 6 publications and I also hold
        a US patent. I have a passion for developing new technologies
        or solutions that enhance people's lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, I love to read and write about philosophical
        and theological subjects, working out and visiting historical and natural places.
